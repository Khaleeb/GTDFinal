## True Terrorism in the Information Age

### **Problem:**
The word "terrorism" often evokes a context for many people that is rarely the actual case. While terrorist incidents are not at all uncommon in the modern age, the idea that comes to many peoples minds of what a terrorist attack is is not often an accurate representation of what most modern terrorist attacks are. Using the Global Terrorism Database,  I hope to make an easy to use and easy to read database containing information on recent attacks. Plot's comparing locations of the attacks, deaths, and perpetrators will help to show the true major contributors to terrorism in the modern era. This is also a topic that changes significantly over time, as different regions of the world fluctuate in political stability and different groups resort to terrorist tactics. Visually depicting the trends in this data could help to reveal repeatting patterns, while drops or spikes in the data may reveal how different events or laws affected global terrorism.

## **Background:**
Terrorism can be defined as "the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims". This definition includes many politically motivated attacks, and is very clearly different from the common stereotypes of terrorism. The data will show the location, time, and date of the attack, as well as who the perpetrators were, who the targets were, wether it was successful, if there was a suicide attack, how many casualties there were, and more.

### **Questions:**
1. Who committed acts of terrorism in the past 10 years? What about specifically on American soil? I hope to show that the distribution of perpetrators is vastly different to what many American's would expect as the stereotypical terrorist. I'd also like to test a certain statement that I've heard frequently about how more American's were killed in recent years due to right-wing terrorism than any other form of terrorism.
2. When and where were these attacks committed? Do certain times, dates, or locations have a significantly higher frequency for attacks? Trends in the settings of these attacks could help to explain motives, or show common patterns in attacks by certain groups.
3. Are there trends in the data for targets/perpetrators within certain groups? For instance, attacks targeted at homosexual's might actually increase in America during February due to pride month, or attacks by right-wing extremist groups might spike before certain voting dates. These trends are especially important, as they could be used to prevent future attacks during these certain patterns.

### **Importance:**
In the age of information, it is more important than ever to learn as much as possible from the data we have. Terrorism is a very serious topic with clear effects on the lives of many, and hopefully the data here will aid by showing preventable patterns. It is also important that we rid ourselves of any form of xenophobic or racist ideas from the past. One of the aims of this data is to show the true distribution of these horrendous acts, and to show how few fit into the outdated stereotypes of terrorism many American's still hold.

### **Dataset:**
From the GTD website: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)™ is the most comprehensive unclassified database of terrorist attacks in the world. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD™ available via this site in an effort to increase understanding of terrorist violence, so that it can be more readily studied and defeated. The GTD™ is produced by a dedicated team of researchers and technical staff, who are supported by an alumni of researchers.  The governance of the database is assured by an advisory board which includes some of the most respected academics in the field of terrorism research.

### **Ethical Concerns and Considerations:**

While this data does show trends in attacks, it does not show the underlying cause for all attacks. Just because certain trends appear, does not mean they all fit into the same category with the same motive. Misinterpretations or malformed conclusions drawn from this dataset could have serious consequences for people. This data is purely intended for education, not for criminal analysis.

If the data in this data set were to disagree with my hypothesis about the majority of attacks not fitting in with the stereotype of terrorism, that would raise some ethical concerns as it would fit into a xenophobic viewpoint.
